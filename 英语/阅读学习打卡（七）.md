What to Know About the Pacific Tsunami

  

From: The New York Times

  

From Japan to Hawaii and California, people were tracking the effects of a tsunami after a powerful earthquake struck overnight in the North Pacific off the coast of Russia's Far East.

  

Hawaii and parts of California spent hours under a tsunami warning, with officials urging residents to stay away from shorelines and seek shelter on higher ground. The waves first hit California around 1 a.m. local time.

  

By Wednesday morning, many official tsunami warnings had been downgraded to advisories, with minimal damage and no reported deaths.

  

Still, officials warned people to stay away from beaches and out of the water as Hawaii and parts of the California coast braced for what could be 24 hours of surging waves and tidal swells. Here's what to know:

  

What triggered this tsunami?

  

An 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck off Russia's eastern coast in shallow waters of the North Pacific on Tuesday morning, causing significant aftershocks and damage to structures in Russia, and setting off a ripple of tsunami warnings from Japan to the California coast, as well as Central and Latin America.

  

If the quake's magnitude is confirmed by scientists, it will be one of the largest ever recorded.

  

What damage has the tsunami caused?

  

As of early Wednesday morning Pacific time, damage in the United States was minimal after the first waves arrived in Hawaii and across the West Coast. In Hawaii, a tsunami warning was downgraded to an advisory after officials said the biggest waves had likely passed and major flooding was not likely.

  

In Oregon and California, officials urged residents to stay vigilant even as warnings were downgraded, saying that dangerous currents could still occur in the water, and waves could continue to surge through the night.

  

In Russia, the earthquake damaged structures and caused cliff faces to collapse into the sea. Videos from the area showed homes and other structures shaking violently and buildings awash in seawater.

  

There have been no reports of injuries or deaths caused by the tsunami so far.

  

What do I do during an earthquake or tsunami?

  

During an earthquake, drop to the ground, cover your body to prevent injuries (by crawling under a table, for example) and hold on, according to the Earthquake Country Alliance.

  

If you are notified that an earthquake may have set off a tsunami in your area, heed the instructions you are given. Move as high and as far inland as you can.

  

But don't wait around for a notification if you notice something is amiss — even a couple of minutes can make a life-or-death difference, Ms. von Hillebrandt-Andrade said. “You have to recognize the natural warning signs,” she said. “If you feel an earthquake that is so strong that you can't stay on your feet and you live in a coastal area, you have to self-evacuate.”

夏威夷和加利福尼亚部分地区发布了长达几个小时的海啸警报，官员敦促民众远离海岸线，前往地势较高的地方寻找躲避处。加利福尼亚已在当地时间凌晨1点左右出现了最早的海啸波。

  

  

shoreline

shelter

  

shelter /ˈʃel.tər/ 表示“掩蔽（处）；遮蔽（处）”，英文解释为“(a building designed to give) protection from bad weather, danger, or attack”如：an air-raid shelter 防空洞。

  

  

By Wednesday morning, many official tsunami warnings had been downgraded to advisories, with minimal damage and no reported deaths.

  

截至美国时间周三早上，许多地方已将海啸警报降级为海啸警告，海啸造成的损失轻微，暂无人员死亡报告。

  

  

downgrade

  

downgrade表示“（使）降级；（使）降职；贬低；轻视”，英文解释为“to reduce someone or something to a lower rank or position, or to cause something to be considered less important or valuable”举个🌰：My job's been downgraded to that of ordinary editor. 我已经被降为普通编辑了。

  

区分：

📍degrade作动词，表示“降低…身份；侮辱…的人格；使受屈辱”，英文解释为：to show or treat sb in a way that makes them seem not worth any respect or not worth taking seriously，举个🌰：This poster is offensive and degrades women. 这张海报冒失无礼，有辱女性尊严。

Still, officials warned people to stay away from beaches and out of the water as Hawaii and parts of the California coast braced for what could be 24 hours of surging waves and tidal swells. Here's what to know:

  

尽管如此，官员们仍警告人们远离海滩，不要下海活动，夏威夷和加利福尼亚部分海岸为可能持续24小时的巨浪和潮涌严阵以待。以下是你应该知道的：

📍The word “brace” in the English language means “two” or a “pair”. When the term “brace” is used in soccer, it is referring to the act of one player scoring 2 goals in a single game. If a player has “scored a brace” it means they have scored twice. 在体育比赛中，也有成双成对的含义，指的就是“两个球”相当于two goals，因此，score a brace或者make a brace就有进两个球的意思，也就是我们常听到新闻报道中出现的“梅开二度”。

  

  

surge

  

surge /sɜːdʒ/ 1）作动词，表示“急剧上升；飞涨；剧增”，英文解释为“If something surges, it increases suddenly and greatly, after being steady or developing only slowly.”举个🌰：The company's profits have surged. 公司的利润激增。

俄罗斯远东海岸附近的北太平洋浅水区于周二早上发生8.8级地震，并伴有强烈余震，导致俄罗斯境内建筑物损毁，同时引发了从日本到加州海岸，乃至中美洲和拉丁美洲的一系列海啸警报。

截至美国太平洋时间周三凌晨，第一波海啸在夏威夷和西海岸沿线出现后造成的损失微乎其微。夏威夷的海啸警报已降级为警告，官员们此前表示，最大的海啸波可能已经过去，不太可能发生大规模的水灾。

  

  

as of

  

as of/from表示“自…起；到...时候为止”，英文解释为“starting from a particular time or date”举个🌰：As of next month, all the airline's fares will be going up. 自下月起，所有航空公司的机票价格都将上调。

  

  

In Oregon and California, officials urged residents to stay vigilant even as warnings were downgraded, saying that dangerous currents could still occur in the water, and waves could continue to surge through the night.

There have been no reports of injuries or deaths caused by the tsunami so far.

  

目前尚无海啸造成人员伤亡的报告。

  

What do I do during an earthquake or tsunami? 地震或海啸发生时应该如何应对？

  

During an earthquake, drop to the ground, cover your body to prevent injuries (by crawling under a table, for example) and hold on, according to the Earthquake Country Alliance.

  

据地震国家联盟建议，地震发生时要“趴下、掩护身体（比如，躲在桌子下）和抓牢”。

  

  

crawl

But don't wait around for a notification if you notice something is amiss — even a couple of minutes can make a life-or-death difference, Ms. von Hillebrandt-Andrade said. “You have to recognize the natural warning signs,” she said. “If you feel an earthquake that is so strong that you can't stay on your feet and you live in a coastal area, you have to self-evacuate.”

  

但如果你注意到有什么不对头的话，不要等通知——生死可能就是那么几分钟的时间，冯·希勒布兰特-安德拉德说。“要会识别自然预警信号，”她说。“如果你住在沿海地区，那里发生了大地震，强度大到让你站不稳的话，你需要自主撤离。”

  

  

amiss

  

amiss /əˈmɪs/ 表示“不对的；不合适的；不正常的”，英文解释为“wrong, not suitable, or not as expected”举个🌰：I could see by the look on their faces that something was amiss. 我从他们的神情上看出，有什么事情出了差错。
