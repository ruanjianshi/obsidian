**Chinese Actor Li Mingde Detained for Car Vandalism While Intoxicated**

**From: ChatGPT**

Beijing's Chaoyang District police reported on Thursday that 28‑year‑old actor Li Mingde has been criminally detained for vandalizing a parked car while under the influence of alcohol.

According to a statement from the district's public security department, Li was apprehended in the Balizhuang area after being observed kicking a car door, scratching its emblem, dislodging its side mirror, and further damaging the vehicle—which had been parked improperly in a public space.

Chinese media have identified the suspect as Li Mingde, who recently stirred controversy on social media by alleging mistreatment by the crew of his new drama, The Triple Echo of Time, and claiming that his former co-star Ma Tianyu was receiving preferential treatment. In the aftermath, both the drama's producer and Li's agency terminated their association with him, and Li announced his departure from the entertainment industry.

The drama began filming in late December, but tensions escalated when Li posted several critical comments online in early January. He accused the production team of substandard treatment and claimed that Ma was acting like a “big shot.” Both the producer and Ma denied these allegations—citing Li's failure to attend scheduled makeup and script-reading sessions as the cause of filming delays.

A native of Shandong province, Li first gained public attention in 2018 with an impressive performance in a school drama, marking his official entry into film and television.

The police statement noted that Li has admitted to his actions, while the owner of the damaged vehicle, surnamed Yang, was issued an administrative penalty for illegal parking. Authorities reminded citizens to park responsibly for the benefit of all and warned against reckless behavior when intoxicated, emphasizing that such actions will inevitably have consequences.
