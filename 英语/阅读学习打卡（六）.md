**American Women Are Giving Up on Marriage**

**From: The Wall Street Journal**

After a handful of underwhelming relationships and dozens of disappointing first dates, Andrea Vorlicek recently called off the search for a husband.

The 29-year-old always thought she'd have found her life partner by now. Instead, she's house hunting solo and considering having kids on her own.

“I'm financially self-sufficient enough to do these things myself,” said Vorlicek, a Boston-based accountant. “I'm willing to accept being single versus settling for someone who isn't the right fit.”

She sees her plans for an independent future as making the best of a lousy situation. “I don't want to sit here and say I'm 100% happy,” Vorlicek said. “But I feel happier just accepting my reality. It's mentally and emotionally a sense of peace.”

American women have never been this resigned to staying single. They are responding to major demographic shifts, including huge and growing gender gaps in economic and educational attainment, political affiliation and beliefs about what a family should look like.

“The numbers aren't netting out,” said Daniel Cox, director of the survey center at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a conservative think tank. He ticked off the data points: More women than men are attending college, buying houses and focusing on their friendships and careers over dating and marriage.

Stories of women complaining about the lack of quality men have long infused pop culture—from “Pride and Prejudice” to Taylor Swift's oeuvre. Yet women throughout history rarely questioned whether finding and securing a romantic partner should be a primary goal of adulthood.

This seems to be changing. Over half of single women said they believed they were happier than their married counterparts in a 2024 AEI survey of 5,837 adults. Just over a third of surveyed single men said the same.

A 2022 Pew survey of single adults showed only 34% of single women were looking for romance, compared with 54% of single men, down from 38% and 61% in 2019. Men were also more likely than women to say they were worried that nobody would want to date them.

A rise in earning power and a decline in the social stigma for being single has allowed more women to be choosy. “They would rather be alone than with a man who holds them back,” Cox said.

For young women especially, who tout their “boy sober” and off-the-market status on TikTok and other social media, the focus has shifted toward self-improvement, friendship and the ability to find happiness on their own. Surveys show a decline in teenage relationships, and Gen Z is having less sex than previous generations, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Stories of women complaining about the lack of quality men have long infused pop culture—from “Pride and Prejudice” to Taylor Swift's oeuvre. Yet women throughout history rarely questioned whether finding and securing a romantic partner should be a primary goal of adulthood.

女性抱怨优质男匮乏的故事早已反映在流行文化中——从《傲慢与偏见》(Pride and Prejudice)到泰勒·斯威夫特(Taylor Swift)的作品，不一而足。然而，从古至今，女性都很少质疑，寻获一位伴侣是否应该是成年后的一个主要目标。

A 2022 Pew survey of single adults showed only 34% of single women were looking for romance, compared with 54% of single men, down from 38% and 61% in 2019. Men were also more likely than women to say they were worried that nobody would want to date them.

A rise in earning power and a decline in the social stigma for being single has allowed more women to be choosy. “They would rather be alone than with a man who holds them back,” Cox said.

For young women especially, who tout their “boy sober” and off-the-market status on TikTok and other social media, the focus has shifted toward self-improvement, friendship and the ability to find happiness on their own. Surveys show a decline in teenage relationships, and Gen Z is having less sex than previous generations, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

对年轻女性来说尤其如此，她们在TikTok和其他社交媒体上宣扬自己“戒断男色”和“智者不入爱河”的状态，她们的关注点已经转向自我提升、友谊和自己寻找幸福的能力。据美国疾病控制与预防中心(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)，调查显示青少年谈恋爱的人数下降，Z世代的性行为数量也少于前几代人。

tout

_The accountant, tired of underwhelming offers during house hunting, resigned, turned self-sufficient, and began writing an oeuvre on demographic shifts, stigma, and affiliation, while touting think tank insights versus his conservative counterparts—choosy, but no longer lousy._
